<p>Personally, I do not find this game as interesting and addictive as people have described it. However, it is a quick game suitable for adults to relieve stress, and a great way for old people to kill time. For example, my grandmother loves this game. Everyday, after a meal, she will lay on her bed and play this game.</p>
